## Get Started 
install dev dependencies

 ## Then Run The app ### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Runs your app in development mode. Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.
It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.
#### `npm run ios` or `yarn run ios`
Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
#### `npm run android` or `yarn run android` Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
